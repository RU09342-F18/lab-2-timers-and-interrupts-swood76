# Button Based Delay
Included in this repository is two examples of a button based delay implementented on two different MSP430 Family Launchpads: MSP430G2553 and MSP430F5529LP.  In this program the user is meant to press button P1.3, so that the already blinking (frequency 10kHz) red and green LEDs, and the time they hold down is counted by the TIMERA module, where ACLK is selected, Up-Count selected, and clock divider of 8 selected. The program functions with the use of two interrupt service routines: TimerA and PORT1 and control flow structures, TIMERA ISR, which is set to count to CCR0, blink the two LEDS, and the PORT 1 ISR, which makes use of both TIMERA module's ACLK in both continuous and count up, continuous on the button press, and count up on release. The time, or frequency held down by the user is now the frequency the LEDS blink at. As mentioned previously, this program works on both the MSP430G2553 and MSP430F5529LP, and does so with not much change other then the main difference being in of course the change in PORT decleration, but also a difference in regiter initialization, and difference in the required initialization of the 32 kHz crystal oscillator on the MSP430G2553, which was necessary to be able to make use of the ACLK as an internal oscillator, which was completely unnecessary on the MSP430F5529LP.
