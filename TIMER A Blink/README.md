# TIMER A Blink
Included in this repository is two examples of source code which is implemnted on both the MSP430G2553 and MSP432P401R. The purpose of the program is to allow the user to press a button and control the speed of the blinking LEDS (RED and GREEN). The program functions with the utilization of two interrupt service routines: TIMERA ISR and PORT 1 ISR. For both cases, the TIMERA module makes use of ACLK in Up-Count mode and the initial and maximum count value is stored in CCR0, the LEDS blink faster when the PORT1 ISR is called, and the button is pressed and the value of CCR0 is decremented. Unfortunately, as of right now, although the necessary naming conventions and port changes have been made to allow this program to compile on the MSP430P401R, it does not function in debug mode. In the development of this code there is a clear distinction other than simply naming convention as to how the MSP430G25553 and MSP430P401R handle interrupts.
